# LeetCode Patterns Prep

> Your pattern-based system for cracking coding interviews.
> Learn the pattern. Memorize the template. Solve 3 problems. Review mistakes. Repeat.
> That's it. That's the whole strategy.

## What This Repo Is

This is a **pattern-first** LeetCode practice repo. Instead of grinding 500 random problems, you learn **5 core patterns** and their sub-patterns, then practice targeted problems for each. Every pattern has templates you can copy-paste into interviews, common traps to avoid, and a curated problem list.

## How to Use This Repo (Beginner Step-by-Step)

1. **Start with** `patterns/00_how_to_use_patterns/` — read it first.
2. **Pick one pattern** (start with Two Pointers, it's the friendliest).
3. **Read the pattern README** — understand *when* and *how to spot* it.
4. **Copy the template** into your editor. Solve the first problem using it.
5. **After solving 3 problems**, read the "Common Pitfalls" section again.
6. **Log your progress** in `progress/tracker.md`.
7. **Move to the next pattern** only when the current one feels natural.

## The Pattern Loop

```
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │                                         │
 │   Learn ──▶ Template ──▶ Solve 3        │
 │     ▲                       │           │
 │     │                       ▼           │
 │   Repeat ◀── Review mistakes            │
 │                                         │
 └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each cycle takes ~2-3 problems. After 2-3 cycles per pattern, you'll start recognizing patterns in new problems automatically.

## 30-Minute Revision Mode

When you're short on time (before an interview, during lunch, etc.):

1. **[5 min]** Pick a pattern you haven't revised recently.
2. **[5 min]** Re-read the README — focus on "How to spot it" and "Common pitfalls."
3. **[15 min]** Solve ONE easy problem from that pattern (timer on, no peeking).
4. **[5 min]** Check `progress/revision_checklists.md` — can you recall every bullet?

That's it. Consistency > marathon sessions.

## 7-Day Beginner Ramp-Up

| Day | Pattern | Goal |
|-----|---------|------|
| 1 | Two Pointers — Opposite Direction | Read README + solve 2 easy problems |
| 2 | Two Pointers — Same Direction | Read README + solve 2 easy problems |
| 3 | Sliding Window — Fixed Window | Read README + solve 2 easy problems |
| 4 | Sliding Window — Variable Window | Read README + solve 1-2 problems |
| 5 | Binary Search — Classic | Read README + solve 2 easy problems |
| 6 | Binary Search — On Answer Space | Read README + solve 1-2 problems |
| 7 | Review Day | Re-solve 1 problem from each pattern (no peeking) |

After Day 7, you'll have touched every major pattern. Then switch to `progress/daily_plan.md` for ongoing practice.

## Progress Tracking

- [`progress/tracker.md`](progress/tracker.md) — Weekly progress table
- [`progress/daily_plan.md`](progress/daily_plan.md) — Your daily practice routine
- [`progress/revision_checklists.md`](progress/revision_checklists.md) — Pre-interview checklists

## Ground Rules

- **No skipping the template.** Always write the skeleton first, then fill in logic.
- **No copy-pasting solutions.** Type every line yourself. Muscle memory matters.
- **Track your mistakes.** The "Notes" column in problems.md is your secret weapon.
- **Revisit, don't just visit.** Solving a problem once means nothing. Solving it again a week later — that's learning.

Good luck. You've got this.
