# Daily Practice Plan

> 30-60 minutes per day. Consistency beats intensity.

## The Daily Routine (Pick One)

### Option A: 30-Minute Quick Session

```
[5 min]  Warm-up: re-read today's pattern README (just "How to spot" + "Pitfalls")
[20 min] Main solve: 1 problem from today's pattern (timer ON, no peeking)
[5 min]  Review: write what went wrong in tracker.md
```

### Option B: 60-Minute Deep Session

```
[5 min]  Warm-up: re-read today's pattern README
[10 min] Template drill: write the template from memory, then check
[30 min] Main solve: 2 problems (1 easy, 1 medium)
[10 min] Review: compare your solution to the representative solution
[5 min]  Log mistakes in tracker.md
```

## Warm-Up Problems (When You're Stuck on What to Solve)

Pick one you've already solved and redo it from scratch:

- Two Pointers: Valid Palindrome
- Sliding Window: Max Sum Subarray of Size K
- Binary Search: Binary Search (classic)
- Top K: Kth Largest Element in an Array

If you can solve your warm-up in < 5 min without help, you own that pattern.

## The "I Don't Feel Like It" Plan

Some days you won't want to practice. On those days:

1. Open ANY pattern README
2. Read just the "Common Pitfalls" section
3. Close the laptop

That's still progress. You kept the streak alive.
